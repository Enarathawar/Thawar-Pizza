				<p>"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."
					Paulo Coelho</p>
				<p> Thawar Pizza founder, Enara Thawar, sought to share her admiration and appreciation of the Italian culture by perfecting numerous recipes through many years of dedication, failure, and most importantly growth. Their vision and confidence in this intention empowered them to achieve through thick and thin. The strength of charity, philanthropy, and knowledge of the Italian culture aided in the creation of a dine-in like none other. This family-owned restaurant is a representation of a rich Italian dine-in located in DFW aimed at making a difference for the guest and the world. </p>
<br>
				<p>"The strength given from family members and supporters enabled the genuine potential of Thawar Pizza to reflect like the sun, and I couldn't be more appreciative for this opportunity to contribute to the world.‚Äù</p>
<br>
				<p> Decades of perfecting our dough, cheese, sauce, and additional recipes have gone into consideration for the most immaculate dine-in experience for you and your cherished ones. Our lavishly embellished dining room fuses cozy low lighting, lively greenery, one-of-a-kind creations from artists in Italy, and the refreshing taste and aroma of our freshly cooked pizzas with a stimulating view of Dallas' skyline to leave you utterly speechless. From the moment our arched doors open to reveal the enraptured setting of Thawar Pizza- until the closing seconds that you spend obsessing over our flawlessly fired traditional dishes, the Thawar family will care for all of your satisfactions and fulfillments when dining.</p>
				<p> Thawar Pizza continues to bring the Italian culture to a new standard through heavenly tasting dishes while also supporting non-profit organizations and perfecting one-of-a-kind recipes.</p>
